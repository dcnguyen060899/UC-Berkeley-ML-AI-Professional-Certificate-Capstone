Patients with extreme severity might have higher mortality rates or more intensive care leading to fewer readmissions, while those with minor severity are less likely to be readmitted.

#### Total Readmissions by Age
![Total Readmissions by Age](images/Total_Readmissions_by_Age.png)
- **Observation:** Patients in the age groups 31-40 and 41-50 have the highest number of readmissions, followed by those in the 21-30 and 51-60 age groups. The lowest number of readmissions is seen in the youngest (0-10) and oldest (91-100) age groups.
- **Interpretation:** This suggests that middle-aged adults (31-50) are more likely to be readmitted, possibly due to a higher prevalence of chronic conditions or lifestyle-related health issues that necessitate repeated hospital care. Younger children and older adults have lower readmission rates, which could be due to differing health care needs and mortality rates.

### Length of Stay

#### Distribution of Length of Stay
![Distribution of Length of Stay](images/los_dist.png)
- **Observation**: The distribution of length of stay shows multiple peaks, with the highest frequencies around 10, 20, and 30 days. There are also smaller peaks at intervals beyond 30 days.
- **Interpretation**: This multimodal distribution suggests that hospital stays often follow standardized durations, likely due to clinical protocols or typical recovery periods for certain treatments. The presence of peaks at regular intervals indicates that many patients are discharged after a predefined period, possibly aligned with the hospital's care plans and discharge policies. The smaller peaks at longer durations may reflect the needs of patients with more complex or severe conditions requiring extended care.

#### Length of Stay by Hospital Type
![Hospital Type Code vs Length of Stay](images/Hospital_Type_Code_vs_Length_of_Stay.png)
- **Observation**: Variability in the length of stay is observed across different hospital types.
- **Interpretation**: Hospital type 'a' has more variability, suggesting it handles a broader range of patient conditions.

#### Length of Stay by Department
![Department vs Length of Stay](images/Department_vs_Length_of_Stay.png)
- **Observation**: Departments such as surgery and TB & Chest disease show longer lengths of stay.
- **Interpretation**: This is expected as these departments typically handle more severe or complex cases.

#### Length of Stay by Ward Type
![Ward Type vs Length of Stay](images/Ward_Type_vs_Length_of_Stay.png)
- **Observation**: Ward types 'T' and 'U' have longer lengths of stay.
- **Interpretation**: Indicates these wards may cater to more critical or long-term care patients.

#### Length of Stay by City Code Hospital
![City Code Hospital vs Length of Stay](images/City_Code_Hospital_vs_Length_of_Stay.png)
- **Observation**: Consistent length of stay across various city codes, but some variability is seen indicating different patient management practices.

#### Length of Stay by Hospital Region
![Hospital Region Code vs Length of Stay](images/Hospital_Region_Code_vs_Length_of_Stay.png)
- **Observation**: Similar length of stay patterns across regions 'X', 'Y', and 'Z'.
- **Interpretation**: Indicates a standardized approach to patient care and management across regions.

#### Length of Stay by Type of Admission
![Type of Admission vs Length of Stay](images/Type_of_Admission_vs_Length_of_Stay.png)
- **Observation**: Trauma admissions tend to have longer stays compared to emergency and urgent admissions.
- **Interpretation**: Reflects the critical nature of trauma cases requiring extended care.

#### Length of Stay by Severity of Illness
![Severity of Illness vs Length of Stay](images/Severity_of_Illness_vs_Length_of_Stay.png)
- **Observation**: As expected, patients with extreme severity of illness have longer stays.
- **Interpretation**: Emphasizes the need for intensive care and prolonged treatment for more severe cases.

### Other Observations

#### Correlation Matrix
![Correlation Matrix of Selected Numerical Features](images/Correlation_Matrix.png)
- **Observation**: Number of visitors with patients shows a positive correlation with the length of stay.
- **Interpretation**: Suggests that patients with more visitors might be staying longer due to more severe conditions or extended recovery times.

#### Distribution of Admission Deposits
![Distribution of Admission Deposit](images/Distribution_of_Admission_Deposit.png)
- **Observation**: Admission deposits show a normal distribution with most values clustering around the mean.
- **Interpretation**: Indicates a standardized billing approach across different admissions.

#### Distribution of Visitors with Patients
![Distribution of Visitors with Patient](images/Distribution_of_Visitors_with_Patient.png)
- **Observation**: Majority of patients have 0-5 visitors, with a sharp drop-off beyond that.
- **Interpretation**: Reflects social support patterns for hospitalized patients.

## Recommendations

- **Focus on High Readmission Departments**: Departments like gynecology with high readmissions should be assessed for possible improvements in patient follow-up care and discharge planning.
- **Regional and Hospital Type Differences**: Address discrepancies in readmission and length of stay across different regions and hospital types to ensure uniformity in patient care.
- **Enhance Trauma Care Facilities**: Given the longer stays for trauma admissions, hospitals should ensure adequate resources and specialized care for these patients.
- **Patient Support Programs**: Implement programs to support patients with longer lengths of stay, including social support and post-discharge follow-ups.

From the distribution from readmission and length of stay across features, I have notice that readmission and length of stay distribution has similar pattern. However, note that not all features that has the same distribution pattern bettewn readmission and length of stay. For example, ward facility code has the highest readmission in code F. But all ward facility codes exhibit a similar pattern in length of stay, with a high concentration of shorter stays (1-3 days).

### Insights from Readmission and Length of Stay Patterns in Categorical Features

The summary statistics and visualizations suggest a pattern where patients with higher readmission counts tend to have longer stays. This pattern can also be observed across different categorical features, such as the type of admission, severity of illness, and hospital departments. Here are some specific insights:

#### Readmission Count vs Length of Stay

The summary statistics table indicates that the mean length of stay decreases slightly as the readmission count increases up to 10, then starts increasing again.

Certainly! Here is a concise version of the table in Markdown format:

- Patients with 0 readmissions have a mean stay of approximately 33 days.
- The mean length of stay for patients with 1-10 readmissions remains relatively stable around 31-32 days.
- For patients with more than 10 readmissions, the mean length of stay increases significantly, suggesting that a subset of patients with frequent readmissions require extended hospital stays due to complications or chronic conditions.


#### 1. Type of Admission

- **Emergency**: Patients admitted through emergency services tend to have varied lengths of stay, with a noticeable portion having longer stays. This category also sees frequent readmissions, indicating that patients admitted in emergencies may require longer recovery times and are more likely to be readmitted.
- **Trauma**: Trauma cases show a higher readmission count, and these patients also tend to have longer stays. This suggests that trauma patients often require extensive care and follow-up treatments, leading to longer hospital stays and higher readmission rates. Refer to the [Total Readmissions by Type of Admission](#total-readmissions-by-type-of-admission) and [Type of Admission vs Length of Stay](#length-of-stay-by-type-of-admission) images.
- **Urgent**: Urgent admissions also display a pattern of higher readmission counts and longer lengths of stay, though not as pronounced as trauma cases. This indicates that urgent cases, while serious, might not require as prolonged care as trauma cases but still exhibit a significant need for readmission and extended stays.

#### 2. Severity of Illness

- **Extreme**: Patients with extreme severity of illness have the longest lengths of stay and highest readmission counts. This is expected, as more severe cases generally require longer hospitalization and are at a higher risk of complications leading to readmission. Refer to the [Severity of Illness vs Length of Stay](#length-of-stay-by-severity-of-illness) and [Total Readmissions by Severity of Illness](#total-readmissions-by-severity-of-illness) images.
- **Moderate**: Patients with moderate severity show a balanced pattern but still exhibit significant lengths of stay and readmission counts, indicating that even moderate cases can be complex and require careful management.
- **Minor**: Minor severity cases have the shortest stays and lowest readmission counts, suggesting that these patients recover quicker and have a lower likelihood of complications that necessitate readmission.

#### 3. Hospital Departments

- **Radiotherapy**: Patients in the radiotherapy department have varied lengths of stay, with a significant number having longer stays. This department also sees higher readmission rates, likely due to the ongoing nature of cancer treatments.
- **Anesthesia**: The anesthesia department has moderate lengths of stay and readmission counts, reflecting the typical recovery times associated with surgical procedures.
- **Gynecology**: Gynecology patients generally have shorter stays and lower readmission counts, suggesting efficient treatment and recovery processes. Refer to the [Total Readmissions by Department](#total-readmissions-by-department) image.
- **TB & Chest disease**: This department shows higher lengths of stay and readmission counts, indicating the complexity and chronic nature of respiratory illnesses. Refer to the [Department vs Length of Stay](#length-of-stay-by-department) image.
- **Surgery**: Surgical patients exhibit a broad range of stay lengths and readmission rates, depending on the type and severity of the surgery performed.


### Confirming the Pattern: Readmission and Length of Stay

1. **Readmission Count vs. Length of Stay**
   ![Readmission Count vs Length of Stay](images/Readmission_Count_vs_Length_of_Stay.png)

   - The box plot indicates a general trend where higher readmission counts are associated with longer lengths of stay. Patients with more frequent readmissions tend to have a higher median length of stay, especially noticeable beyond 10 readmissions.

2. **Cumulative Stay vs. Length of Stay**
   ![Cumulative Stay vs Length of Stay](images/Cumulative_Stay_vs_Length_of_Stay.png)

   - The scatter plot shows the distribution of cumulative stays in relation to individual lengths of stay. While there are some outliers, the data points suggest that patients with longer individual stays tend to accumulate more days in the hospital overall, reinforcing the pattern observed in the readmission count. Overall, The visualization reinforces the pattern observed in the statistical summary. Higher readmission counts are generally associated with longer lengths of stay.

### Implications

These insights imply that:

- **Higher Readmission and Length of Stay**: Certain categories, such as trauma admissions and patients with extreme severity of illness, consistently show higher readmission counts and longer lengths of stay. This suggests that these patient groups are particularly vulnerable and may benefit from more intensive post-discharge care and monitoring to reduce readmissions and hospital stay durations.
- **Focused Interventions**: Hospitals can implement targeted interventions for high-risk groups, such as trauma and severe illness patients, to manage their care more effectively. This could include enhanced discharge planning, follow-up care, and outpatient support to reduce the likelihood of readmission and shorten hospital stays.
- **Resource Allocation**: Understanding these patterns can help hospitals allocate resources more efficiently. Departments with higher readmission rates and longer stays may require additional staff, specialized equipment, or dedicated programs to manage patient care more effectively.

## Analysis

### Classification Reports
The classification reports for all models show:
- **Precision and Recall**: Precision and recall scores vary significantly across different classes, with lower scores for certain classes indicating that the models are struggling to predict those accurately.
- **F1-Score**: The F1-scores are generally lower for classes 4, 6, and 7, suggesting that these classes are particularly challenging for the models.

### Confusion Matrices
The confusion matrices highlight:
- **Misclassifications**: High levels of misclassifications for certain classes, especially those with fewer instances in the dataset, suggest that the models may be overfitting to more frequent classes.
- **Diagonal Dominance**: Diagonal values (correct predictions) are not as dominant as desired, indicating that the models have room for improvement in accuracy.

### ROC-AUC Curves
The ROC-AUC curves reveal:
- **Class-Wise Performance**: The models perform well for certain classes with AUC scores above 0.80, while performance is lower for others, indicating the need for further model tuning or additional feature engineering.
- **Overall AUC**: Generally high AUC scores (above 0.70) for most classes suggest that the models have a reasonable ability to distinguish between different length-of-stay classes.

## Conclusion and Recommendations
- **Model Selection**: While all models exhibit reasonable performance, CatBoost, XGBoost, and the Neural Network model show the best test accuracy and AUC scores, making them preferable for this task.
- **Feature Engineering**: Further feature engineering, particularly focusing on classes with lower performance, could help improve model accuracy.
- **Class Imbalance**: Addressing class imbalance through techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or using class weights could improve model performance for underrepresented classes.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Further hyperparameter tuning, especially for models like CatBoost, XGBoost, and the Neural Network, may yield further performance improvements.

By addressing these areas, the predictive accuracy and generalization capability of the models for patient length of stay can be enhanced, leading to more reliable predictions and better-informed healthcare management decisions.

Implementing the deep learning model can lead to substantial cost savings by accurately predicting patient length of stay, reducing the impact of misclassification on hospital resources and patient care. Further tuning and enhancement of this model, combined with continuous monitoring, can optimize performance and maximize financial benefits.


# Deployment

## Immediate Implementation Plan

Based on the analysis insights, we propose the following immediate actions to optimize hospital operations and improve patient care:

1. **Resource Allocation Enhancement**:
   - **High-Demand Departments**: Allocate additional resources (staff, equipment, beds) to high-demand departments such as gynecology and surgery to manage patient flow better and reduce bottlenecks.
   - **Targeted Distribution**: Utilize predictive models to forecast patient inflow and length of stay, enabling proactive resource allocation to departments with higher admission rates and longer stays (e.g., surgery, TB & Chest disease).

2. **Bed and Staff Management Optimization**:
   - **Bed Grade Management**: Assign beds based on patient severity and expected stay duration to optimize the use of high-grade beds for patients who need them most.
   - **Extra Room Utilization**: Optimize the use of extra rooms for patients requiring extended care, improving patient management and reducing wait times for new admissions.

3. **Specialized Care for Medium-Stay Patients**:
   - **Focused Interventions**: Develop specialized care pathways and interventions for patients with stays of 10-40 days to manage their conditions more effectively, reducing their length of stay and freeing up hospital resources.

4. **Visitor Management Program**:
   - **Structured Programs**: Implement structured visitor programs to balance patient support with operational efficiency, potentially reducing the length of stay and improving patient throughput.

5. **Financial Policy Adjustments**:
   - **Admission Deposit Review**: Revise financial policies to ensure admission deposits do not inadvertently extend hospital stays, helping manage patient turnover more effectively and ensuring equitable access to care.

6. **Addressing Regional Disparities**:
   - **Sharing Best Practices**: Share best practices from high-performing hospitals in regions with better patient outcomes and resource management (e.g., Region X) with lower-performing regions (e.g., Region Z) to elevate the overall standard of care.
   - **Geographical Strategy**: Tailor resource allocation and management strategies based on regional differences in hospital capacities and patient demographics.

7. **Enhanced Follow-Up Care for High-Risk Patients**:
   - **Targeted Follow-Up Programs**: Implement targeted follow-up care and support post-discharge for patients with higher readmission rates, such as those admitted for trauma or with severe illnesses, to reduce the likelihood of readmissions and ensure better long-term patient outcomes.

8. **Continuous Model Improvement**:
   - **Data-Driven Adjustments**: Regularly update and fine-tune predictive models with new data to ensure resource allocation strategies remain effective and responsive to changing patient needs and hospital capacities.

## Summary of Business Impact

The implementation of these strategies based on predictive insights and data analysis can lead to significant cost savings and operational improvements:

- **Resource Allocation**: Optimized distribution of resources to high-demand areas, reducing bottlenecks and improving patient care.
- **Length of Stay Reduction**: Specialized interventions and structured programs to reduce the length of stay for medium-stay patients.
- **Readmission Rates**: Enhanced follow-up care for high-risk patients to reduce readmission rates.
- **Financial Efficiency**: Revised financial policies to manage patient turnover more effectively.

## Financial Impact

The deployment of these strategies is expected to result in substantial cost savings:

- **Deep Learning Model**: Potential savings of $30,388,400 by minimizing costs associated with false positives and false negatives.
- **Traditional Models**: Significant savings ranging from $19,988,400 to $22,388,400 across different machine learning models.

By implementing these immediate actions, hospitals can improve operational efficiency, enhance patient care quality, and achieve significant cost savings, paving the way for a data-driven approach to healthcare management.
