            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Duy Nguyen. I am a economics grad with expertise in machine learning and artificial intelligence. I graduated with a Bachelor in Economics and Data Analysis. I recently completed the UC Berkeley ML AI Professional Certificate program, where I honed my skills in data analysis, predictive modeling, and problem-solving. These projects have strengthened my programming skills, deepened my mathematical intuition, and fostered my intellectual curiosity, naturally converging into my current research pursuits in AI safety, specifically in the theoretical analysis of generalization within the overparameterized regime in Deep Learning Theory and Interpretability.</p>

                <h3><a href="index_gpa_analysis.html">Academic Performance Analysis - Statistical Pattern Recognition</a></h3>
                <p>
                    Conducted a comprehensive statistical analysis of academic performance using R-squared analysis and phase recognition. The project demonstrates:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Applied statistical analysis to identify distinct academic growth phases (Adjustment, Transition, Stabilization, Mastery)</li>
                        <li>Implemented data visualization using React and Recharts to create an interactive dashboard</li>
                        <li>Quantified academic growth through R-squared analysis, showing progression from initial volatility (R² = 0.262) to strong linear correlation (R² = 0.855)</li>
                        <li>Demonstrated resilience and continuous improvement through data-driven insights</li>

                <h3><a href="https://mosaicmate.vercel.app/">MOSAIC - AI Immigration Chatbot</a></h3>
                <p>
                    Developed an AI-powered chatbot with SFU Blueprint for MOSAIC to assist Canadian Immigration Consultants, significantly enhancing user experience by providing personalized recommendations and real-time information in multiple languages. Leveraging technologies such as Flask for backend services, Neo4j for graph database integration, and OpenAI models for natural language processing, the chatbot efficiently processes user queries and retrieves relevant information. The project was shortlisted in the Top 4 of the SFU CS Diversity Award, recognizing its innovative approach to improving accessibility and efficiency for newcomers, immigrants, and refugees.

                <h3><a href="https://vha-roi-slab-retrieval-engine.onrender.com">Simon Fraser University Faisal Lab - AI Medical Translation & Retrieval Engine</a></h3>
                <p>
                    Developed a retrieval augmented generation software that translates doctors’ natural language requests into JSON, streamlining access to CT and MRI scan analytics through the DAFs application. Eliminated the need for medical professionals to memorize complex codes for report retrieval, potentially saving hours of manual reference time per week. Utilized Python and frameworks such as Llama Index and the OpenAI API to develop the software, enhancing efficiency and accuracy in processing natural language to JSON conversion.
