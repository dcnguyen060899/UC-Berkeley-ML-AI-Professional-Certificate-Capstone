            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I’m Duy Nguyen, an MS in Data Science student at Seattle University. With my Bachelor's in Economics and UC Berkeley ML AI Professional Certificate, I am specializing in <strong>causal inference</strong> for tech, economics, and product platforms. I work with the <strong>PyWhy</strong> stack—<strong>DoWhy</strong> (assumptions → identification → refutation) and <strong>EconML</strong> (CATE/IV estimators)—as baselines, extending them with <strong>large neural models</strong> (neural IV, causal transformers) for treatment effects and counterfactuals. I also study how <strong>interpolation thresholds/double descent</strong> shape generalization in high-dimensional causal settings. My goal is to deliver <strong>interpretable, decision-ready</strong> causal insights for experiments, policy, and product decisions.
